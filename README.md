# cortex-compete

This project is made to show how to inlcude a couple of keep robotics code components:

1 - LCD chooser for various autonomous routines, skills, competition placmenet
2 - PID code for drive train including driving forward/backwards, pivot and swing turns
3 - PID code for a lift - have lift raise to a set poitn and hold for example.

It also includes a method to run autonomous() routines without havign access to A VEXnet switch.

This code comes as is and is an example only for you to build out from.  To make this code match your robot you need at a minimum adjust the portdef.h file where all Cortex ports are declared.
